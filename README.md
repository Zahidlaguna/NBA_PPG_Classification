# NBA_PPG_Classification
This is a beginner machine learning project that I have been working on on my spare time. 
The main premise of this notebook file is to show using a classification model how many players in the NBA average 25 points per game on a efficient field goal percentage(above 40%). 
I will also try to incorporate with position has the highest ppg average, and which position shoots the most efficent.
